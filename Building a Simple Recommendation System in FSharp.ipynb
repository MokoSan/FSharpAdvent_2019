    "# Building a Simple Recommendation System in FSharp\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./pics/Title.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This year, I decided to work on a Simple Recommender for TMDB (The Movie Database) data that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). I'd like to keep this article as lucid as possible with the least amount of dependencies and ceremony to highlight the ease of the domain modelling, tooling and data manipulation functionality in F#. Recommendations are given on the basis of the metadata of the movie inputted based on the genres, keywords, overview, production studio and popularity score. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is written using .NET Jupyter Notebooks whose instructions to get started can be found [here](https://github.com/dotnet/try/blob/master/NotebooksLocalExperience.md). The impetus behind writing this post was to help me and others better understand the internals of a very simple Recommendation System but also to exemplify the now improving strength of the .NET ecosystem to conduct experiments by the means of a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will load the CSV file, extract and clean the pertinent fields and create domain based objects off the data.\n",
    "2. We will create a vector that gives us the frequencies of individual words in a word soup.\n",
    "3. We will create functions that compute a `distance` between the word frequency vectors and popularity of two different movies.\n",
    "4. We will give recommendations based on the movie inputted by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step involves installing all the pertinent nuget packages, which can be done in the following manner in addition to importing the relevant paths and setting the path to the csv containing all the data appropriately:"
